# aging_triplex2

This code was written to allow the detection and analysis of repeats, GQ and triplex motifs across mitochondrial genomes and in relation to mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints.
The uploaded code is a streamlined version that should be able to run in R with at most minor modifications. Please note, that that many of the
functions will break down and produce nonsense if they are not used as intended.
